parameters :
    genomes :
        ui-name : |
            Input FASTA file
        short-hint : |
            FASTA file containing microbial or viral metagenomes
        long-hint  : |
            FASTA file containing microbial or viral metagenomes

    database:
        ui-name: |
            Reference database
        short-hint: |
            Reference database to use in identifying viral sequences
        long-hint: |
            Reference database to use in identifying viral sequences, can either be RefSeq or Viromes. Use Viromes unless you really don't trust enivornmental data.

    add_genomes:
        ui-name: |
            Additional phage references
        short-hint: |
            Add custom phage sequences to serve as references
        long-hint: |
            Add custom phage sequences to serve as references

    virome:
        ui-name: |
            Enable virome decontamination
        short-hint: |
            Run VIRSorter assuming that most data is viral
        long-hint: |
            Run VIRSorter for datasets that are mostly viral to force use of generic metrics of enrichment instead of calculated from the dataset.

    diamond:
        ui-name: |
            Enable diamond?
        short-hint: |
            Flag to enable Diamond instead of BLASTP
        long-hint: |
            Comparisons use BLASTP by default, using Diamond will increase speed in the case of many additional phage sequences.

    keep_db:
        ui-name: |
            Keep HMM+BLAST DBs created from added phage sequences
        short-hint: |
            Keep HMM+BLAST DBs created from added phage sequences
        long-hint: |
            Keep HMM+BLAST DBsn from added phage sequences, useful if you have custom phages that you want to include in several different analyses and want to use VIRSorter against them.

    no_c:
        ui-name: |
            Use if no predicted viruses
        short-hint: |
            Flag to enable different calculation of enrichment statistics
        long-hint: |
            If no viruses are predicted, enable to force VIRSorter to use a perl (vs C) script to calculate enrichment statistics

    binned_contig_name:
        ui-name: |
            BinnedContig Object Name
        short-hint: |
            The name for the output BinnedContig object.
